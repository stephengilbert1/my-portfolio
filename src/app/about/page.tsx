      <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg mb-4">
        I&apos;m a mechatronics engineer pivoting into software development
        based in Vancouver, BC.

      <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg mb-4">
        I bring over 7 years of experience as a multidisciplinary engineer
        working on new product development and automated manufacturing
        equipment. Across these roles I have developed a love for solving
        technical problems. My favourite thing about being an engineer is that
        our jobs constantly require us to learn new things.

        This portfolio showcases the journey I have been on to sharpen up the
        coding skills I picked up during my engineering degree and build
        tangible projects that solve real world problems. In the Projects page
        you&apos;ll find tools and products that could be applied in the
        electrical utility industry, where I currently work, as well as tech
        tools for the recreational activities I love such as skiing and mountain
        biking.
